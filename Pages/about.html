  <h1>WHO AM I</h1>
  <p>Hi, I am Jerin Joseph. This is my retro-style personal site.</p>
  <p>Iâ€™m a Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in web development, software testing, and digital technologies. I enjoy creating websites and applications, exploring how design meets functionality, and constantly learning new tools to improve my skills.

I work with different technologies including the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and WordPress. With WordPress, I build and customize websites using themes, plugins, and custom code to make sites both professional and user-friendly.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Building projects using the MERN stack</li>
  <li>Designing and customizing WordPress websites</li>
  <li>Improving my skills in software testing</li>
  <li>Exploring digital marketing strategies</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p>Outside of coding and tech, I like to experiment with new ideas, work on creative projects, and keep up with the latest trends in technology.

My goal is to grow as a developer and problem-solver, while also creating websites and projects that are simple, useful, and fun. This website is my personal space to share my journey of learning and building.</p>
