  <h1>ðŸ‘¾ Welcome to Jerin's World ðŸ‘¾</h1>

  <p>
    Hi, Iâ€™m <span class="highlight">Jerin Joseph</span> â€” a Computer Science graduate, explorer of technology,  
    and someone who enjoys blending creativity with code.
  </p>

  <p>
    This website is my little <span class="highlight">digital playground</span>,  
    built in a retro game style. Think of it as my personal hub where I share  
    who I am, what Iâ€™m learning, and the projects Iâ€™m working on.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the left, youâ€™ll find links to my <span class="highlight">profile</span>,  
    a section with <span class="highlight">updates</span>,  
    and my <span class="highlight">gallery</span> where Iâ€™ll post snapshots, creations, and memories.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy experimenting with design, gaming aesthetics, and building websites  
    that feel fun to use. This is not just a portfolio â€” itâ€™s an interactive  
    corner of the web that reflects my personality.
  </p>

  <p>
    ðŸš€ Expect this site to grow with new content, cool updates, and maybe even  
    hidden surprises (like an Easter egg or two ðŸ‘€).
  </p>

  <p>
    Thanks for visiting, and donâ€™t forget: <span class="highlight"> explore!</span>
